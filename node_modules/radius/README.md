# R A D I U S
The purpose of this library is to enable all developers to use the design guidelines set by the Funding Circle design team. With that in mind, we’ve built this documentation so that it’s easy for anyone to use a collection of variables, mixins, functions and utility classes.

Check the styleguide [here](http://fundingcircle.github.io/radius/).

## Requirements
* nodejs
* npm

## How to use
You can easily import this repository into your project using `npm`. Just amend `devDependencies` of your project's `package.json` file with:
```
"devDependencies": {
  "radius" : "git@github.com:FundingCircle/radius.git#1.0.0"
}
```
After that, run `npm install` and you are all set!

## Build
Source files are located in `src` and are built into the build directory. This is `dist` by default.

### Overriding the build path
You may want to override the build path, for example to develop styles on one of the other Funding Circle projects. Override the build path using the environment variable `BUILD_PATH`.
e.g.
```shell
$ BUILD_PATH=/path/to/fca-frontend gulp build
```

## Sandbox
When you build new components or features, test them in the `sandbox` directory.

## Releasing a new version
1. Create a new branch
1. Bump the version number in `package.json`
1. Commit and push your changes
1. After code review, merge to `master`
1. Add notes about the new release on GitHub
